    ">An object is like a clear plastic box that contains a piece of data. The object has a *type*, such as a boolean or integer, that determines what can be done with data...in Python, if an object has the type `int`, you know that you could add it to another `int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values contained within an object can either be changed (mutable) or remain constant (immutable). Using the same box exampe above:\n",
    ">Think of an immutable object as a closed box with a clear window: you can see the value but you can't change it. By the same analogy, a mutable object is like an open box: not only can you the value inside, you can also change it; however you can't change it's type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values can either be data-type (such as a string, integer, float, boolean, etc) or class (code). "
